  </h3>

  <div class="feed-item-meta">
      <span class="feed-item-date">21 december, 2016 - 18:03</span>
  </div>

  <div class="feed-item-body">
    <p></p>
<p>Drupal.org's Composer endpoints have been available in beta for some time now, and in that time we've begun to see many, many people use Composer to manage Drupal modules and themes. We first launched these repositories before DrupalCon New Orleans as an alpha release, and move into beta a few months later. After receiving your feedback and bug reports we've made updates, and are ready to call this service stable.</p>
What is Composer?
<p>Composer is a tool for dependency management in PHP. It allows you to declare the libraries your project depends on and it will manage (install/update) them for you.</p>
<p>… Composer is strongly inspired by node's npm and ruby's bundler." - <a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md" rel="nofollow">Source</a></p>

<p>In a nutshell, Composer allows you to declare the dependencies of your project in a composer.json file in the root of your PHP project. Those dependencies, which you then install through Composer, can have their <em>own</em> composer.json files and their own dependencies—all of which will be automatically managed and installed by Composer. When you need specific control over the versions of dependencies, you can use a <a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md#composer-lock-the-lock-file" rel="nofollow">composer.lock</a> file.</p>
<p>You can read more about Composer at <a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md" rel="nofollow">GetComposer.org</a>.</p>
How do Drupal.org's composer repositories work?
<p>Drupal.org offers two Composer repositories—one for Drupal 7, and one for Drupal 8. Composer requires that packages adhere to semantic versioning, which Drupal 8 core does, but Drupal 8 contrib, and Drupal 7 core and contrib, don’t. To solve this problem, we've created a Composer façade, which takes all of the metadata about projects on Drupal.org and translates them into a format Composer can understand—including translating the Drupal-specific versioning for Drupal 7 and contrib into semantic versioning.</p>
<p>By creating this façade, we've made sure that Drupal.org is still the canonical source for metadata about Drupal.org projects, and that we can update this translation layer as the versioning schema changes. (Learn more about the effort to <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/1612910" rel="nofollow">move Contrib projects to semantic versioning</a>).</p>
<p>In addition to providing endpoints for building projects, Drupal's automated testing suite— <a href="https://www.drupal.org/drupalorg/docs/drupal-ci/using-drupalci-on-drupalorg" rel="nofollow">DrupalCI</a>—now uses Composer to test Drupal core and contributed projects. This allows developers to test any external dependencies.</p>
How do I use Drupal.org's Composer repositories?
<p>To begin using Drupal.org's Composer repositories, you'll need to update your composer.json file to include the appropriate Composer repository for the version of Drupal. To use Composer with Drupal 7, use the repository url:</p>

https://packages.drupal.org/7<p>. To use Composer with Drupal 8, use the repository url:</p>

https://packages.drupal.org/8<p>, as in this example.</p>
<p>After setting up composer, simply run the command:</p>

$ composer config repositories.drupal composer https://packages.drupal.org/8
<p>And your project's composer.json should be updated to look like the following:</p>

{ 
    "repositories": { 
        "drupal": {
            "type": "composer",
            "url": "https://packages.drupal.org/8" 
        }
    }
}
<p>Once you've made that change, you should be able to use Composer for Drupal modules and themes as you would for any other PHP package, using the drupal/ namespace:</p>

$ composer require drupal/&lt;modulename&gt;
<p>There is one caveat about the pattern: there are some namespace collisions among modules, and so it is on our roadmap to update Drupal.org project pages to specify the exact namespace to use to require a given project.</p>
<p>To learn more about how to use Drupal.org's Composer repositories, and for some troubleshooting tips, read the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2718229" rel="nofollow">Project Composer documentation</a>.</p>
What about licensing?
<p>All the projects hosted on Drupal.org are licensed GPLv2 or later or have an <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/drupalorg_whitelist" rel="nofollow">entry in the packaging whitelist</a>. This means that you can rely on Drupal Core and contributed modules and themes to be licensed under the GPL or compatible. And if you need to redistribute your code created with Drupal projects, it must be redistributed as GPL-2.0 or GPL-3.0, but please note that Drupal.org will only host GPL-2.0 licensed projects.</p>
<p>However, because Composer is a tool that can manage packages in the wider PHP ecosystem, you might find that you want to require a non-GPL package in your project. Using GPL-licensed Drupal projects with external packages that are GPL compatible is fine. Just be aware that if you redistribute that code, you will have to redistribute under a GPL license.</p>
<p>We cannot provide legal advice for your use of open source software. If you use Composer to install packages that are not compatible with the GPL alongside GPL-licensed projects like Drupal, you may use that software together, but per the terms of the GPL you may not copy, distribute, or modify that software.</p>
<p>"Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted…" <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.en.html#section0" rel="nofollow">GPL 2.0 Section 0</a>.</p>
<p>For more questions about Drupal and the GPL you can read the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/about/licensing" rel="nofollow">Licensing FAQ</a>.</p>
The Composer "licenses" command
<p>If you need to check what licenses are in use by your Composer-installed dependencies, you can use the <a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/03-cli.md#licenses" rel="nofollow">licenses command</a>: </p>
<p>$ composer licenses </p>
<p>This will list the licenses of all the packages your project is using. However, we recommend that all users double check licensing information as some of these packages may be dual-licensed or have other licensing concerns that may not be immediately apparent from this command. </p>
What's next?
<p>At this point, the Drupal.org Composer service is stable and you can use it to manage modules and themes in your production websites. That said, we do have a roadmap of additional features that we'd like to add. And your contributions are welcome!</p>
<p>As development on Drupal.org's Composer service continues, we want to focus on the following features:<br />
Supporting Composer-based workflows for distributions and install profiles<br />
Providing sub-tree splits of Drupal Core<br />
Updating project pages to provide information about using Composer with any given Drupal.org hosted project<br />
Adding features to the updates service, to collect statistics about projects installed with Composer, and to explore providing update alerts about external dependencies<br />
We also hope to work with core maintainers to add the Drupal.org Composer repositories to <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2758737" rel="nofollow">Drupal Core's composer.json</a> file</p>
<p>If you're interested in learning more about our roadmap for Composer, or contributing to this service on Drupal.org, you can learn more in the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2551607" rel="nofollow">Composer plan issue</a>.</p>

  <div class="feed-item-body">
    <p>Earlier this year, I talked about The Drupal Association stepping further into <a href="https://assoc.drupal.org/blog/megansanicki/drupal-associations-12-month-focus" rel="nofollow">its mission to better promote Drupal</a> through its channels - especially via Drupal.org. With 20 million unique visitors annually, Drupal.org is a powerful tool to help evaluators move through their Drupal adoption journey. However, our research showed that technical evaluators didn’t find the information they needed and they ultimately left the site to find Drupal information elsewhere.</p>
<p>It was a real missed opportunity that we wanted to solve for. Not only is it our mission to promote Drupal, but helping Drupal businesses thrive is important. Knowing that <a href="https://www.drupal.org/blog/who-sponsors-drupal-development" rel="nofollow">69% of code contribution is sponsored by Drupal businesses,</a> it’s imperative that our business community is strong and able to continually support our contributors.</p>
<p>The Association is in a unique position to help these evaluators get inspired and informed about Drupal and to quickly connect them to service provider experts, who can show them how to use Drupal to solve their business challenges. That is why we turned the Drupal.org front page into a Drupal marketing section, giving it new design, copy, and calls to action for visitors to learn more about Drupal 8 and how to Try Drupal. We will continue to iterate the copy, case studies, and call to action on this page and subpages throughout 2017.</p>
The Power of Drupal By Industry
<p>Our next iteration will be the addition of industry vertical pages, which highlight the power of Drupal solutions for various industries.</p>
<p>Each page will explain the impact that Drupal solutions made for well known brands in each industry. The pages will also connect the visitor to an industry expert - a Drupal service provider - who can answer their questions and ultimately build their Drupal solution. Plus, each page highlights featured third-party technology and hosting companies who add value to a Drupal solution.</p>
<p>Our first three industry pages will be for the higher education, government, and the media/entertainment industry verticals. They will launch in Q1 2017.</p>
<p>Here is a <strong><em>work-in-progress mockup</em></strong> of the Higher Education Industry Page.</p>
<p></p>
Sponsors with a history of contribution
<p>As you can see, we only highlight three service providers on each industry page. Naturally we have a global network of experts who we can highlight. So how do we decide who gets promoted on these pages?</p>
<p>While working with the Drupal Association Board, we decided that it is important to continually reward the businesses who contribute back to the Project.</p>
<p>Contribution comes in the form of time, talent, and treasure. We looked at these three categories and decided to rank companies by the issue credits they earned over the last 90 days, what level they are in the Drupal Supporting Partner Program, and how many years they were Supporters. We are using this contribution ranking to invite the top service providers to sponsor the page.</p>
<p>We are also using geo-targeting on each page, showcasing service providers who serve the region that the visitor is located in. That means that each page will highlight three service providers who offer services in the Americas, EMEA, and AP Australia/NZ. This allows us to expand the number of organizations to participate in this program.</p>
<p>Of course, the visitor can still find all of the other amazing Drupal businesses in our ecosystem by going to the marketplace, which can be filtered by industry verticals as well.</p>
<p>We are excited to push our mission work forward on several fronts from promoting Drupal to rewarding contributing organizations. As we launch this program, we want to thank the Drupal Association Board, Acquia, FFW, Lullabot, MediaCurrent, and Phase2 for providing input into the process.</p>  </div>

  <div class="feed-item-meta">

    <p>Read our <a href="https://www.drupal.org/drupalorg/roadmap">Roadmap</a> to understand how this work falls into priorities set by the Drupal Association with direction and collaboration from the Board and community.</p>
<p>The engineering team at the Drupal Association had much to be thankful for in November. With the support of the wonderful volunteers in our community and the contributions of our Supporting Partners we were able to deliver some great tools for the project. Let's dive and see what's new.</p>
Drupal.org updates
Promoting Drupal by Industry
<p></p>
<p>In November we finished the technical scaffolding for the upcoming industry pages, and began working with the wider Association team on content development for these pages. Because we were ahead of our internal targets for this page and we felt it would add significant value, we've also added the ability to geotarget content on these industry pages.</p>
<p>This is the first instance of geo-targeting on Drupal.org, and we'll be using it to help connect Drupal evaluators with regionally appropriate content and partners on these pages. Work on the industry pages is ongoing, but we're excited to bring them to you soon.</p>
Developer Tools Evaluation
<p>During November the engineering team also had a two day retreat here in Portland, OR with <a href="../../../u/webchick/index.html">webchick</a> - one of the members of the Technical Advisory Committee. We used this retreat to do a deep dive into the current state of developer tools on Drupal.org, and to evaluate our options to continue evolving the tools we offer to the community.</p>
<p>We gave a summary of our exploration along with some next steps to the Drupal Association Board on November 22nd. You can find the <a href="https://assoc.drupal.org/node/18863">minutes and a recording here</a>.</p>
Core release packaged with --no-dev composer dependencies
<p>Starting with the Drupal 8.2.3 release, we are now packaging full releases of Drupal core with <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2745355">--no-dev composer dependencies</a>. This means that packages downloaded will not include extraneous developer extras that should not be used in production sites, and that the release packages will be smaller. We will continue to package dev releases with the dev dependencies.</p>
Feature branch testing support
<p>Drupal.org allows maintainers to create feature branches for issues by using the name format [issue#]-[short-description]. Any commits made to a branch in this format will appear in the sidebar of the associated issue. To improve the utility of these feature branches, DrupalCI patch file tests now also run on push to these branches.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To add tests, users can simply click on the 'add test' link beneath the git branch in the issue sidebar, or click on the existing test result bubble to re-test or add a new test. Since this feature was introduced we've run over 200 issue branch tests.</p>
Project maintainers can add Documentation Guides
<p></p>
<p><br />
We're continuing to support the migration of documentation to the new documentation system, and we've now enabled Project Maintainers to <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2679643">add related documentation guides</a> to their projects. Once added, the related projects will appear on the documentation guides, in the sidebar.</p>
Documentation Maintainers can find their Guides
<p>Many community volunteers have stepped up to <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2682083">become maintainers</a> of the new documentation guides. We want to make sure we're giving them the tools they need to do the work of maintaining those guides and the pages within them.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We've added a 'Your Guides' section to the user profile which will list all of the guides that a user maintains, as well as the pages within those guides. This should allow maintainers to see when pages have been recently changed or added, and to easily keep their guide content curated and up to date.</p>
Infrastructure
Virtualization and Improved Config Management
<p>In November, we completed the majority of two major infrastructure projects. Firstly, we've virtualized the majority of the infrastructure and standardized on Debian 8 images. Secondly we've updated our configuration and user management from Puppet 3 + LDAP to Puppet 4 + Hiera. This is a significant milestone for our infrastructure, and gives us a more portable and maintainable infrastructure to manage moving forwards.</p>
Community Initiatives
<p><a href="https://www.drupal.org/drupalorg/roadmap/community-initiatives">Community initiatives</a> are a collaboration; with dedicated community volunteers building improvements to Drupal.org with the architectural guidance and oversight of the Drupal Association engineering team.</p>
Drupal 8 User Guide Launched!
<p>We're very happy to say that the Drupal 8 User Guide is <a href="https://www.drupal.org/docs/user_guide/en/index.html">now live on Drupal.org</a>! This documentation guide is carefully curated to provide all the information a new user needs to become skilled at managing a Drupal 8 site. We want to give a special thanks to <a href="https://drupal.org/u/jhodgdon">jhodgdon</a> for all her work on the User Guide project.</p>

On this day last year we celebrated <a href="http://buytaert.net/drupal-8-0-0-released">the release of Drupal 8</a> with over <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/drupal-8-release-parties">200 parties around the world</a>. It's a project we worked on for almost five years, bringing the work of more than <a href="https://youtu.be/yOggQwNFl3w">3,000 contributors together</a> to make Drupal more flexible, innovative, scalable, and easier to use.</p>
<p>To celebrate tomorrow's release-versary, I wanted to look back at a few of the amazing Drupal 8 projects that have launched in the past year.</p>
1. <a href="http://www.nba.com/">NBA.com</a>
<p></p>
<p>The NBA is one of the largest professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada. Millions of fans around the globe rely on the NBA's Drupal 8 website to livestream games, read stats and standings, and stay up to date on their favorite team. Drupal 8 will bring you courtside, no matter who you're rooting for.</p>
2. <a href="http://business.nasdaq.com/intel/ir-management/communication-and-compliance/ir-websites">Nasdaq</a>
<p></p>
<p><a href="http://buytaert.net/nasdaq-using-drupal-8-for-new-investor-relations-websites">Nasdaq Corporate Solutions has selected Drupal 8</a> as the basis for its next generation Investor Relations Website Platform. IR websites are where public companies share their most sensitive and critical news and information with their shareholders, institutional investors, the media and analysts. With Drupal 8, Nasdaq Corporate Solutions will be providing companies with the most engaging, secure, and innovative IR websites to date.</p>
3. <a href="http://www.hubert-burda-media.com/">Hubert Burda Media</a>
<p></p>
<p>For more than 100 years, Hubert Burda Media has been Germany's premier media company. Burda is using Drupal 8 to expand their traditional business of print publishing to reach more than 52 million readers online. Burda didn't stop there, the media company also open sourced <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/thunder">Thunder</a>, a distribution for professional publishers built on Drupal 8.</p>
4. <a href="http://www.jurassicworld.com/">Jurassic World</a>
<p></p>
<p>Drupal 8 propels a wide variety of sites, some of Jurassic proportion. Following the release of the blockbuster film, Jurassic World built its digital park on Drupal 8. Jurassic World offers fans games, video, community forums, and even interactive profiles all of the epic dinosaurs found on Isla Nublar.</p>
5. <a href="http://www.wwf.org.uk/">WWF</a>
<p></p>
<p>The World Wide Fund for Nature has been a leading conservation organization since its founding in 1961. WWF's mission is to protect our planet and Drupal 8 is on their team. WWF UK uses Drupal 8 to engage the community, enabling users to adopt, donate and join online. From pole to pole, Drupal 8 and WWF are making an impact.</p>
6. <a href="https://www.ymcamn.org/">YMCA Greater Twin Cities</a>
<p></p>
<p>The YMCA is one the leading non-profit organizations for youth development, healthy living, and social responsibility. The YMCA serves more than 45 million people in 119 countries. The team at YMCA Greater Twin Cities turned to Drupal 8 to build OpenY, a platform that allows YMCA members to check in, set fitness goals, and book classes. They even hooked up Drupal to workout machines and wearables like Fitbit, which enables visitors to track their workouts from a D8 powered mobile app. The team at Greater Twin Cities also took advantage of Drupal 8's built-in multilingual capabilities so that other YMCAs around the world can participate. The YMCA has set a new personal record, and is a great example of what is possible with Drupal 8.</p>
7. <a href="http://www.jackdaniels.com/en-us">Jack Daniels</a>
<p></p>
<p>The one year anniversary of Drupal 8 is cause for celebration, so why not raise a glass? You might try Jack Daniels and their Drupal 8 website. Jack Daniels has been making whiskey for 150 years and you can get your fill with Drupal 8.</p>
8. <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/">Al Jazeera Media Network</a>
<p></p>
<p>Al Jazeera is the <a href="http://buytaert.net/how-al-jazeera-successfully-managed-through-the-turmoil">largest news organization focused on the Middle East</a>, and broadcasts news and current affairs 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Al Jazeera required a platform that could unify several different content streams and support a complicated editorial workflow, allowing network wide collaboration and search. Drupal 8 allowed Al Jazeera to do that and then some. Content creators can now easily deliver critical news to their readers in real time.</p>
9. <a href="http://www.alabama.gov/">Alabama.gov</a>
<p></p>
<p>From Boston to LA and even Australia, Drupal is supporting the digital needs of governments around the globe. Alabama is leading the way with Drupal 8. Alabama.gov puts its citizens first, and demonstrates how open source can change the way the public sector engages online.</p>
10. <a href="https://www.box.com/">Box</a>
<p></p>
<p>Box has been a leader in the technology industry since its founding in 2005. Box takes advantage of Drupal 8 and the improved features made available right out-of-the-<strong>box</strong>. Bad puns aside, companies like Box are using Drupal 8's new features and improved user interface to build the best digital experiences yet.</p>
11. <a href="http://www.habitat.org/">Habitat for Humanity</a>
<p></p>
<p>The historic nonprofit Habitat for Humanity doesn't just build houses for those in need; they build <a href="http://www.habitat.org/">habitat.org</a> on Drupal 8. Habitat for Humanity provides affordable housing for communities in over 70 countries around the world. You can discover their impact through the "Where we Build” interactive map, donate, and volunteer all on their Drupal 8 site.</p>
12. <a href="https://www.obermeyer.com/">Obermeyer</a>
<p></p>
<p>Obermeyer and Drupal 8 will take you into new territory. The ski wear company offers seamless end to end commerce integration, providing both new and loyal customers a great shopping experience. Let Obermeyer's Drupal 8 integration with Drupal Commerce keep you warm because winter is coming ...</p>
Happy 1st birthday Drupal 8!
<p>I can't think of a better way to celebrate Drupal 8's one year anniversary than by sharing some incredible experiences that are being created with Drupal 8. Whether the project is big or small, features dinosaurs, or spreads awareness for an important cause, I'm proud to say that Drupal 8 is supporting an amazing array of projects. In my recent <a href="https://buytaert.net/state-of-drupal-presentation-september-2016">keynote at DrupalCon Dublin</a>, I explained why <a href="http://buytaert.net/drupal-collective-purpose">the why of Drupal</a> is so important. After one year of Drupal 8, it's clear how powerful our collective purpose, projects, and passions can be.</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who has continued to contribute to Drupal 8! I can't wait for another year of exciting projects. Special thanks to <a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/pdjohnson">Paul Johnson</a> for crowdsourcing great examples that I wouldn't have known about otherwise.</p>

  <div class="feed-item-body">
    <p>As a best practice, development tools should not be deployed on production sites. Accordingly, packaged Drupal 8 stable releases will no longer contain <a href="http://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#require-dev" rel="nofollow">development PHP libraries</a>, because development code is not guaranteed to be secure or stable for production.</p>
<p>This only applies to a few optional libraries that are provided with Drupal 8 for development purposes. The many stable required libraries for Drupal 8, like Symfony and Twig, will still be included automatically in packaged releases. Drupal 7 is not affected.</p>
Updating your site
<p>To adopt this best practice for your site, do one of the following (depending on how you install Drupal):</p>
<ul><li>If you install Drupal using the <strong>stable release packages provided by Drupal.org</strong> (for example, with an archive like <a href="https://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/drupal-8.2.2.tar.gz" rel="nofollow">drupal-8.2.2.tar.gz</a> or via <a href="https://github.com/drush-ops/drush" rel="nofollow">Drush</a>), update to the next release (8.2.3) as soon as it is available. (<a href="https://www.drupal.org/docs/7/choosing-a-drupal-version/overview#when" rel="nofollow">Read about core release windows</a>.) Be sure to follow the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2700999" rel="nofollow">core update instructions</a>, including removing old vendor files. Once updated, your site will no longer include development libraries and no further action will be needed.</li>
<li>If you use a <strong>development snapshot</strong> on your production site (like <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/8.2.x-dev" rel="nofollow">8.2.x-dev</a>), you should either update to a stable release (preferred) or manually remove the dependencies. Remember that development snapshots are not supported for production sites.</li>
<li>If you install your site <strong>via Composer</strong>, you should update your workflows to <a href="https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/using-composer/using-composer-to-manage-drupal-site-dependencies" rel="nofollow">ensure you specify --no-dev</a> for your production sites.</li>
</ul>Development and continuous integration workflows
<p>If you have a continuous integration workflow or development site that uses these development dependencies, your workflow might be impacted by this change. If you installed from a stable Drupal.org package and need the development dependencies, you have three options:</p>
<ol><li>Install <a href="https://getcomposer.org/" rel="nofollow">Composer</a> and run composer install --dev,</li>
<li>Use a development snapshot (for example, 8.2.x-dev) instead of a tagged release for your development site, or</li>
<li>Install the development dependencies you need manually into Drupal's vendor directory or elsewhere.</li>
</ol><p><strong>However, remember that these development libraries should not be installed on production sites.</strong></p>
<p>For background on this change, see <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2745355" rel="nofollow">Use "composer install --no-dev" to create tagged core packages</a>. For more information on Composer workflows for Drupal, see <a href="https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/using-composer/using-composer-to-manage-drupal-site-dependencies" rel="nofollow">Using Composer to manage Drupal site dependencies</a>.</p>  </div>

    <p>Read our <a href="https://www.drupal.org/drupalorg/roadmap">Roadmap</a> to understand how this work falls into priorities set by the Drupal Association with direction and collaboration from the Board and community.</p>
<p>The Drupal Association team has been getting back to work after coming back from DrupalCon Dublin in September. For the engineering team, October has been focused on some back-end services and infrastructure that support the Drupal project, while we continue to move forward on some longer term front facing initiatives.</p>
Drupal.org updates
Promoting Drupal by Industry
<p><a href="https://www.drupal.org/drupalorg/blog/whats-new-on-drupalorg-september-2016">Last month</a> we talked about the new homepage we released for Drupal.org, and using those editorial tools to build a membership campaign. We hinted that additional changes will be coming soon. While we're not ready to launch this new content - we can talk about it in some greater detail.</p>
<p>Dries Buytaert, the project founder, has called Drupal the platform for ambitious digital experiences. That phrase expresses the incredible power and flexibility of Drupal, but also encapsulates an aspect of Drupal that can be difficult for newcomers. It can be very hard for newcomers to Drupal to understand how to take a base install of Drupal core, and extend that to achieve that ambitious vision.</p>
<p>We want to help close that gap in understanding—to help evaluators see how Drupal achieves these ambitions. To do this, we'll be creating a series of landing pages that focus granularly on how Drupal creates success stories in particular industries. Look for more on this topic in coming months.</p>
DrupalCon Vienna Site Launched
<p></p>
<p>As is tradition, during the closing session of DrupalCon Dublin we announced that the next DrupalCon in Europe will be held in Vienna! We launched the splash page announcing the event at <a href="https://vienna2017.drupal.org/">vienna2017.drupal.org</a> and we have information about sponsorship and hotel reservations already available.</p>
<p>DrupalCon Vienna will happen from the 25th to 29th of September 2017, and we'll hope to see you there!</p>
More flexible project testing
<p></p>
<p>We've made a significant update to how tests are configured on the Automated Testing tab of any project hosted on Drupal.org. Automated testing, using the DrupalCI infrastructure, allows developers to ensure their code will be compatible with core, and with a variety of PHP versions and database environments. In October, we updated the c<a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2651208">onfiguration options for module maintainers</a>.</p>
<p>Maintainers can now select a specific branch of core, a specific environment, and select whether to run the test once, daily, on commit, or for issues. Issues are limited to a single test configuration, to ensure that the code works in a single environment before being regression tested against multiple environments on on-commit or daily tests.</p>
Better database replication and reliability
<p>Behind the scenes, we've made some updates to our database cluster - part of our infrastructure standardization on Debian 8 environments managed in Puppet 4. We've made some improvements to replication and reliability - and while these changes are very much behind the scenes they should help maintain a reliable and performant Drupal.org.</p>
Response to Critical Security Vulnerabilities
<p></p>
<p>When it rains, it pours—a maxim we take to heart in Portland, Oregon—and that was especially true in the realm of security in October. The most widely known vulnerability disclosed was the '<a href="https://dirtycow.ninja/">DirtyCow</a>' vulnerability in the Linux kernel. A flaw in the copy-on-write system of the Linux kernel made it possible, in principle, for an unprivileged user to elevate their own privileges.</p>
<p>Naturally, responding to this vulnerability was a high priority in October, but DirtyCow was not the only vulnerability disclosed, as security releases were also made for PHP, mariadb, tar, libxslt, and curl. We mitigated each of these vulnerabilities in short order.</p>
Community Initiatives
<p><a href="https://www.drupal.org/drupalorg/roadmap/community-initiatives">Community initiatives</a> are a collaboration; with dedicated community volunteers building improvements to Drupal.org with the architectural guidance and oversight of the Drupal Association engineering team.</p>
Drupal 8 User Guide
<p>The Drupal 8 User Guide is getting very close to being available on Drupal.org. We are working closely with contributor <a href="https://drupal.org/u/jhodgdon">jhodgdon</a> to resolve some <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2757921">perplexing inconsistencies</a> between what we're seeing in our development environment and in our initial production deployment.</p>
Dreditor
<p><a href="https://drupal.org/u/markcarver">markcarver</a> who is currently <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/1673278">leading the charge</a> to port Dreditor features to Drupal.org, has invited anyone interested in contributing to join him in #dreditor on freenode IRC or the <a href="https://github.com/unicorn-fail/dreditor">Dreditor GitHub issue queue</a>.</p>
Documentation Maintainership
<p>Finally, we want to continue to encourage the community to <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2682083">become maintainers of Drupal documentation</a>. If you are a developer interested in contributing code to the new documentation system, please <a href="https://www.drupal.org/user/999848/contact">contact tvn</a>.</p>
<p>———</p>
<p>As always, we’d like to say thanks to all the volunteers who work with us, and to the Drupal Association <a href="https://drupal.org/supporters">Supporters</a>, who made it possible for us to work on these projects.</p>
<p>If you would like to support our work as an individual or an organization, consider becoming a <a href="https://assoc.drupal.org/membership">member of the Drupal Association</a>.</p>

<p class="center"><a href="http://buytaert.net/nasdaq-using-drupal-8-for-new-investor-relations-websites" rel="nofollow"></a></p>
<p>I wanted to share the exciting news that <a href="http://business.nasdaq.com/intel/cs.html" rel="nofollow">Nasdaq Corporate Solutions</a> has selected Drupal 8 as the basis for its next generation Investor Relations Website Platform. About 3,000 of the largest companies in the world use Nasdaq's Corporate Solutions for their investor relations websites. This includes 78 of the Nasdaq 100 Index companies and 63% of the Fortune 500 companies.</p>
<p>What is an IR website? It's a website where public companies share their most sensitive and critical news and information with their shareholders, institutional investors, the media and analysts. This includes everything from financial results to regulatory filings, press releases, and other company news. Examples of IR websites include <a href="http://investor.starbucks.com/" rel="nofollow">http://investor.starbucks.com</a>, <a href="http://investor.apple.com/" rel="nofollow">http://investor.apple.com</a> and<a href="http://ir.exxonmobil.com/" rel="nofollow">http://ir.exxonmobil.com</a> -- all three companies are listed on Nasdaq.</p>
<p>All IR websites are subject to strict compliance standards, and security and reliability are very important. Nasdaq's use of Drupal 8 is a fantastic testament for <a href="http://drupal.org/" rel="nofollow">Drupal</a> and Open Source. It will raise awareness about Drupal across financial institutions worldwide.</p>
<p>In their <a href="http://www.nasdaqomx.com/newsroom/pressreleases/pressrelease?messageId=1497526" rel="nofollow">announcement</a>, Nasdaq explained that all the publicly listed companies on Nasdaq are eligible to upgrade their sites to the next-gen model "beginning in 2017 using a variety of redesign options, all of which leverage Acquia and the Drupal 8 open source enterprise web content management (WCM) system."</p>
<p>It's exciting that 3,000 of the largest companies in the world, like Starbucks, Apple, Amazon, Google and ExxonMobil, are now eligible to start using Drupal 8 for some of their most critical websites. </p>  </div>

<p>This month's update comes to you a couple weeks late, but only because we were on site at DrupalCon together with the community to move the project forward! DrupalCon Dublin was a great event, with the entire Drupal Association staff engaged to make DrupalCon the best place to develop your Drupal skills, learn what's coming for the project, and sprint on core and contrib. We are tremendously thankful to the community that joins us for DrupalCon, and to the incredible volunteers that help us put on the event. If you couldn't join us in person, you can still review the <a href="https://events.drupal.org/dublin2016/schedule/2016-09-27">session recordings</a>.</p>
<p>Now, on to the updates!</p>
Drupal.org updates
New homepage
<p class="center"></p>
<p>Certainly the most visible change to Drupal.org in September was the refresh of our home page. As the front door of our community home, the front page needs to be inviting to both existing community members, and people new to Drupal who are just beginning their adoption journey. The changes are more than aesthetic. We also put in place new editorial tools to give us greater flexibility with the front page itself, and with future landing pages that we hope to create in the same highly-designed, attractive style. In addition to these structural and editorial changes we made some content changes as well, cleaning up our news feed, and giving DrupalCon a new, more prominent position on the home page.</p>
<p>And there are more updates to come! Using the same editorial tools we'll soon be rolling out additional content for Drupal evaluators - promoting proven solutions built using Drupal in specific industries. Look forward to this in the coming months.</p>
Membership campaign
<p>We used the same editorial tools that built the new homepage to build a landing page for our fall <a href="../../../association/membership/index.html">membership campaign</a>. This campaign showcases how Drupal Association members make community cultivation grants possible - and the stories that those grants create.</p>
<p class="center"></p>
<p>These community stories run to the heart of our mission - enabling our global community build connections on the local level, and extending Drupal's reach across the world.</p>
Case studies on organization profiles
<p>In September we also made a small but significant update to organization profiles. We've moved the often unwieldy index of people associated with an organization to a subpage, in order to make room for listing the case studies that an organization has created. We want to encourage Drupal organizations of all kinds to share their stories of success, especially around Drupal 8.</p>
<p>If your organization has never created a Drupal case study before, we have some materials to teach you <a href="https://www.drupal.org/drupalorg/docs/content/case-studies">how to create a case study</a> on Drupal.org.</p>
Issue Credit Updates
<p>The issue credit system has had a remarkable impact on the community. Being able to quantify the contribution of organizations to Drupal's codebase has lead to an unprecedented level of healthy competition between organizations who support the project—each trying to outdo the other with their contributions. It has been amazing to see how generous these organizations are, sponsoring the work of committed community contributors to advance the project.</p>
<p>To maintain this system in a healthy way, we need to monitor it carefully and make small adjustments to ensure that we're creating the right incentives for true contribution, and not a system to be gained for self-promotion. We've made a few small tweaks in september to reduce spurious re-opening of issues in order to 'reset the clock' on credits, and we have a few more fixes on the plate to keep this ecosystem healthy.</p>
<p>We're also looking to expand the kinds of activities that receive contribution credit - so look forward to further updates on that front in the coming months.</p>
Community Initiatives
<p>Finally, here are some updates on our active <a href="https://www.drupal.org/drupalorg/roadmap/community-initiatives">community initiatives</a>. Community initiatives are a collaboration; with dedicated community volunteers building improvements to Drupal.org with the architectural guidance and oversight of the Drupal Association engineering team.</p>
Documentation Migration
<p>The migration of Drupal.org documentation to the new documentation content types is well under way. Tremendous thanks to <a href="../../../u/tvn/index.html">tvn</a> and <a href="../../../u/eojthebrave/index.html">eojthebrave</a> for spearheading this effort and recruiting additional volunteers to help maintain the new documentation guides and move the community over into the new system.</p>
<p>We still need your help! We need community volunteers to <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2682083">take on small sub-sets of documentation to maintain</a>, and make sure they're cleaned up post-migration.</p>
<p>If you don't want to commit to maintaining a guide, you can still help out by doing some of the pending tasks for any of the documentation pages.</p>
<p>Lastly, if any Drupal developers are interested in contributing code to the new documentation system to clean up a few minor bugs and features, please <a href="https://www.drupal.org/user/999848/contact">contact tvn</a>.</p>
Drupal 8 User Guide
<p>As outlined in our previous update, the Drupal 8 User guide is a special subset of documentation that's been produced in a highly curated, editorially controlled way - to create a guide to Drupal 8 that rivals the standards of an industry publication. All of the components needed to publish this guide to Drupal.org are now in place, so our final step will be to coordinate some last tweaks and bug fixes with <a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/jhodgdon">jhodgdon</a>, and then to begin linking it prominently on Drupal.org.</p>
Dreditor
<p>In the weeks leading up to DrupalCon Dublin there was a small crisis in the contributor community. Because of changes in the browser add-on validation process, the incredibly valuable and popular Dreditor browser extension, first developed by <a href="../../../u/sun/index.html">sun</a>, and currently maintained by <a href="../../../u/markcarver/index.html">markcarver</a>, and<a href="../../../u/cottser/index.html">cottser</a> has reached its end of life—or has it?</p>
<p>After a tremendous outpouring from the community a new plan was made, and now Mark is working on porting the features of Dreditor directly to Drupal.org. Work is still ongoing, but as it proceeds, users will be able to optionally enable these features component by component on their user profiles.</p>
<p>———</p>
<p>As always, we’d like to say thanks to all the volunteers who work with us, and to the Drupal Association <a href="https://drupal.org/supporters">Supporters</a>, who made it possible for us to work on these projects.</p>

    <p>At DrupalCon Dublin, I spoke about The Association’s commitment to help Drupal thrive by improving the contribution and adoption journeys through our two main community assets, DrupalCon and Drupal.org. You can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQLzrlMeySU" rel="nofollow">see the video here</a>.</p>
<p>One area I touch on was my experience as a new code contributor. Contributing my patch was a challenging, but joyous experience and I want more people to have that feeling—and I want to make it as easy as possible for others to contribute, too. It’s critical for the health of the project.</p>
<p>At the heart of the Drupal contributor community are our custom development tools, including the issue tracker, Git repositories, packaging, updates server, and automated testing. We believe there are many aspects of Drupal’s development workflow that have been essential to our project's success, and our current tooling reflects and reinforces our community values of self-empowerment, collaboration, and respect, which we seek to continue to uphold.</p>
<p>It’s time to modernize these developer tools. To support the Association with this objective The Drupal Association created a Technical Advisory Committee (TAC). The TAC consists of community members <a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/webchick" rel="nofollow">Angie Byron</a>, <a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/moshe-weitzman" rel="nofollow">Moshe Weitzman</a>, and <a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/spf13" rel="nofollow">Steve Francia</a>, who is also our newest Drupal Association board member. The TAC acts in an advisory role and reports to me.</p>
<p>Building off of the work the community has already done, the TAC is exploring opportunities to improve the tools we use to collaborate on Drupal.org. The crux of this exploration is determining whether we should continue to rely on and invest in our self-built tools, or whether we should partner with an organization that specializes in open source tooling.</p>
<p>Our hope is that we will be able to bring significant improvements to our contribution experience faster by partnering with an organization willing to learn from our community and adapt their tools to those things we do uniquely well. Such a partnership would benefit both the Drupal community—with the support of their ongoing development—and potentially the broader open source community—by allowing our partner to bring other projects those aspects of our code collaboration workflow.</p>
<p>The TAC will use a collaborative process, working with staff and community to make a final recommendation. The TAC has already begun the process and has some very positive exploratory conversations. The TAC and staff will be communicating their progress with the community in upcoming blog posts.  </p>  </div>

</ul>Description
<p>Recently the Drupal Security Team has seen a trend of attacks utilizing a site mis-configuration.<br />
This issue only affects sites that allow file uploads by non-trusted or anonymous visitors, and stores those uploads in a public file system. These files are publically accessible allowing attackers to point search engines and people directly to them on the site.  The majority of the reports are based around the webform module, however, other modules are vulnerable to this misconfiguration as well. </p>
<p>For example, if a webform configured to allow anonymous visitors to upload an image into the public file system, that image would then be accessible by anyone on the internet. The site could be used by an attacker to host images and other files that the legitimate site maintainers would not want made publicly available through their site.</p>
To resolve this issue: 
<ol><li>Configure upload fields that non-trusted visitors, including anonymous visitors, can upload files with, to utilize use the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/documentation/modules/file#access">private file system</a>.</li>
<li>Ensure cron is properly running on the site. Read about setting up cron for <a href="https://www.drupal.org/docs/7/setting-up-cron/overview"> for Drupal 7 </a> or <a href="https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/setting-up-cron/overview"> or Drupal 8</a>).</li>
<li> Consider forcing users to create accounts before submitting content.</li>
<li> Audit your public file space to make sure that files that are uploaded there are valid.</li>
</ol>Awareness acknowledgment
<p>The Drupal Security Team became aware of the existence and exploits of this issue because the community <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/101494">reported this issue to the security team</a>. As always, if your site has been exploited, even if the cause is a mistake in configuration, the security team is interested in hearing about the nature of the issue. We use these reports to look for trends and broader solutions. </p>

  <div class="feed-item-body">
    <p><a href="../../../project/drupal/releases/8.2/index.html"></a></p>
<p><strong>Update: <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/8.2.1">Drupal 8.2.1 is now available</a>.</strong></p>
<p><a href="../../../project/drupal/releases/8.2/index.html">Drupal 8.2.0</a>, the second minor release of Drupal 8, is now available. With Drupal 8, we made significant changes in our release process, adopting semantic versioning and scheduled feature releases. This allows us to make extensive improvements to Drupal 8 in a timely fashion while still providing backwards compatibility.</p>
What's new in Drupal 8.2.x?
<p>This new version includes additional experimental modules to place blocks on pages, to edit configuration related to blocks without leaving the page, to create content moderation workflows, and to use date ranges. Several smaller authoring experience, site building, and REST and decoupled site improvements are included as well. (<a href="https://www.drupal.org/core/experimental">Experimental modules</a> are provided with Drupal core for testing purposes, but are not yet fully supported.)</p>
<p><a class="link-button" href="../../../project/drupal/releases/8.2/index.html">Download Drupal 8.2.0</a></p>
Easier to place and configure blocks on pages
<p>The new experimental <em>Place Block</em> module allows placing blocks on any page without having to navigate to the backend administration form. After selecting the region for placement, block configuration can be adjusted in a modal dialog allowing full control of all the details.</p>
<p>There is also a much easier way to modify block configuration, with the experimental <em>Settings Tray</em> module. Editing a block opens a tray in a sidebar with the block's title and other settings. For the site name block, for example, you can edit the site name directly in the sidebar. For menu blocks, you can adjust the menu there.</p>
<p></p>
Content moderation now included
<p>Drupal has always supported both published and unpublished content, but more granular workflow support was not available in Drupal core. The new experimental <em>Content Moderation</em> module, based on the contributed <em>Workbench Moderation</em> project, allows defining content workflow states such as Draft, Archived, and Published, as well as which roles have the ability to move content between states.</p>
<p></p>
Support for date ranges
<p>The <em>Datetime</em> module included with core only supports storing single points in time. The experimental <em>Datetime Range</em> module provides a new field type that also allows end dates. This is important for helping contributed modules like the <em><a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/calendar">Calendar</a></em> module to work with Drupal 8 core.</p>
Site building, content authoring, and administrative improvements
<p>Drupal 8.2.0 also improves stable functionality for administration, site building, and authoring. Drupal now enables revisions by default for new content types, to provide better accountability, to create a "safety net" for recovering from unintended changes, and to integrate with future workflow features. Content editors will enjoy a more seamless experience, as CKEditor's built-in dialogs are now styled to match Drupal-native dialogs, and creating any entity will always display a message linking to the new entity.</p>
<p>Other incremental enhancements include:</p>
<ul><li>The user interface text has been improved on numerous administrative pages.</li>
<li>The redirection of site-wide contact forms is now configurable.</li>
<li>The comment view mode can now be selected in the display formatter form.</li>
<li>Relative URLs are converted to absolute ones in generated RSS feeds (ensuring that images and links work wherever the feeds are used).</li>
<li>Administrators can now elect to remove a module's content entities in order to uninstall the module.</li>
<li>The internal page cache has been improved for 404 responses.</li>
</ul>Platform features for web services
<p>The Drupal 8.2 release continues to expand Drupal's support for web services that benefit decoupled sites and applications, with bug fixes, simplified configuration, improved responses, and new features. It is now possible to read (GET) configuration entities like vocabularies and content types as REST resources, resolving a significant limitation for REST functionality in 8.1.x and earlier. Login, logout, and user registration are also now possible with REST. The authentication mechanism used by a REST Export Views Display is now configurable, and a cors.config service parameter was added for enabling and configuring cross-origin resource sharing (CORS). REST resource configuration is now also significantly simpler.</p>
<p></p>
Developer API improvements
<p>Minor releases like Drupal 8.2.0 include backwards-compatible API additions for developers as well as new features. Read the <a href="../../../project/drupal/releases/8.2/index.html">8.2.0 release notes</a> for more details on the improvements for developers in this release.</p>
What does this mean to me?
Drupal 8 site owners
<p>Update to 8.2.0 to continue receiving bug and security fixes. The next bugfix release, 8.2.1, is scheduled for November 2, 2016.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2700999">Updating your site</a> from 8.1.10 to 8.2.0 with update.php is exactly the same as updating from 8.1.7 to 8.1.8. Modules, themes, and translations may need small changes for this minor release, so test the update carefully before updating your production site.</p>
Drupal 6 site owners
<p><a href="https://www.drupal.org/drupal-6-eol">Drupal 6 is not supported anymore</a>. Create a Drupal 8 site and try <a href="https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/upgrade/upgrading-from-drupal-6-or-7-to-drupal-8">migrating your data</a> into it as soon as possible. Your Drupal 6 site can still remain up and running while you test migrating your Drupal 6 data into your new Drupal 8 site. Core now provides migrations for most Drupal 6 data, but the migration of multilingual functionality in particular is not complete. If you find a new bug not covered by the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/search/drupal?project_issue_followers=&amp;status%5B%5D=Open&amp;version%5B%5D=8.x&amp;component%5B%5D=migration+system&amp;issue_tags_op=%3D">known issues with the experimental Migrate module suite</a>, your detailed bug report with steps to reproduce is a big help!</p>
Drupal 7 site owners
<p>Drupal 7 is still fully supported and will continue to receive bug and security fixes throughout all minor releases of Drupal 8.</p>
<p>The migration path from Drupal 7 to 8 is not complete, especially for multilingual sites, so you may encounter errors or missing migrations when you try to migrate. That said, since your Drupal 7 site can remain up and running while you <a href="https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/upgrade/upgrading-from-drupal-6-or-7-to-drupal-8">test migrating into a new Drupal 8 site</a>, you can help us stabilize the Drupal 7 to Drupal 8 migration path! Testing and bug reports from your real-world Drupal 7 sites will help us stabilize this functionality sooner for everyone. (<a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/search/drupal?project_issue_followers=&amp;status%5B%5D=Open&amp;version%5B%5D=8.x&amp;component%5B%5D=migration+system&amp;issue_tags_op=%3D">Search the known issues</a>.)</p>
Translation, module, and theme contributors
<p>Minor releases like Drupal 8.2.0 are backwards-compatible, so modules, themes, and translations that support Drupal 8.1.x and Drupal 8.0.x will be compatible with 8.2.x as well. However, the new version does include some changes to strings, user interfaces, and <a href="../../../core/d8-bc-policy/index.html">internal APIs</a> (as well as more significant changes to <a href="../../../core/experimental/index.html">experimental modules</a>). This means that some small updates may be required for your translations, modules, and themes. See the <a href="../../../drupal-8.2/index.html">announcement of the 8.2.0 release candidate</a> for more background information.</p>

    <a href="https://www.drupal.org/about/media-kit/first-annual-drupal-ceo-survey">The first annual Drupal CEO Survey reports that there is a bright future for Drupal in the enterprise segment</a>
  </h3>

  <div class="feed-item-meta">
      <span class="feed-item-date">29 september, 2016 - 10:42</span>
  </div>

  <div class="feed-item-body">
    <p><strong>Results from the global Drupal CEO business survey conducted by One Shoe and Exove, in partnership with the Drupal Association, indicate that Drupal will adopt a role as an enterprise level platform. The Drupal CEO Survey has been carried out this year out for the first time and gives insights in the key issues that Drupal agency owners and company leaders worldwide face.</strong></p>
<p>Among the surveyed 75 Drupal companies, the C-level respondents mainly work at digital agencies (37.8%) and software companies (27%). Most of the surveyed companies were small to medium sized enterprises. Only 9.9% said they have more than 80 employees, while 21.9% reported five or less employees.</p>
A bright future for Drupal in the enterprise segment
<p>A vast majority (90.5%) believes that Drupal has reinvented itself with the release of Drupal 8, the newest version of the CMS, released in November 2015. Even though Drupal has become somewhat more complex, respondents don’t think this is a turnoff for developers (77.1%). As one respondent said, "Some developers will resent the added complexity, but I see it becoming the defacto standard for 'Enterprise' CMSs." This respondent is not the only one: 89.2% of the respondents think that the popularity of Drupal for clients will grow in the next three years. Drupal is seen as being a leader in larger enterprise deployments in the future. As one respondent stated, "Drupal will see continued growth for clients who are committed to their digital strategy and see its importance as part of their overall business goals. But it will probably tail off for clients who just need a website." Or, as another respondent sees it: "Drupal will become the platform of choice for enterprise level solutions."</p>
Drupal is popular for enterprise healthcare projects
<p>The surveyed companies serve clients in numerous industries. From enterprise perspective, the major industries are healthcare and medicine (40.0% respondents have clients from this industry), banking and insurances (38.7%), and retail (37.3%). Overall, Drupal companies also work with charities and non-profit organizations (64%), government and public administration (56.0%), media (49.3%), IT (45.3%), and arts and culture (36.0%).</p>
<p>The cost of an enterprise solution project varies from company to company. Most of the companies (28.0%) work in 100,000 - 250,000 euro range, while 18.7% of the companies charge 250,000 - 500,000 euro. Another 18.7% charge 50,000 - 100,000 euro for an enterprise level solution built on Drupal. Only a handful of companies, 4.0%, charge between half a million and one million euro. Compared to the typical cost of enterprise level solutions, Drupal based solutions are implemented with less costs. This is due to the good fit of Drupal to the enterprise needs, flexibility of the platform, and huge amount of readymade modules.</p>
<p class="center"></p>
Drupal empowers growth
<p>The most important strategic priorities of the companies also focus on growth: finding the right talent, 53.3%; ensuring financial growth, 45.3%; and developing new growth strategies, 41.3%. The executives expect to face challenges in the coming three years on the same areas: finding the right talent, 59.5%; talent retention, 36.5%; and ensuring financial growth, 33.8%.</p>
<p>While finding and retaining the talent is seen challenging, 60.0% of the respondents do not outsource work to vendors. Companies operating in Europe less use outsourcing, as 67.0% of these companies do not employ vendors. European companies outsource work to Asia (17.0%) and Europe (17.0%), while non-European companies use vendors in North America (25.0%), South America (25.0%), and Asia (19%).</p>
<p>Also illustrating the growth-empowering aspects of Drupal is the geographical presence of companies. One third (31.1%) of the surveyed companies have offices in more than one country, and 12.0% has offices in five or more countries.</p>
Comments
<p>The survey organizers Janne Kalliola from Exove and Michel van Velde from One Shoe are very happy with the results. "This survey confirms a number of positive indications about Drupal which we have been seeing in our markets. I am especially happy with the strong enterprise focus of Drupal companies across the globe, as our experiences with enterprise customers have confirmed that Drupal is an excellent fit to enterprise," Janne Kalliola says. Michel van Velde continues: "We are foreseeing steady growth of Drupal in a number of markets. There are so many untapped opportunities for Drupal and it’s great to see that Drupal 8 is now equipped to compete with closed source solutions like Sitecore and Adobe.”</p>
<p>Megan Sanicki, Executive Director at Drupal Association says, "I am excited that this survey has been made and so many Drupal companies have answered the call. The results validate the positive and energetic feeling we see and hear in the Drupal marketplace. To help the agencies, the Drupal Association is working together with the Drupal business community to amplify Drupal’s success on Drupal.org. We connect enterprises evaluating Drupal with agencies providing Drupal services, we organize DrupalCons to attract and train new talent to work with Drupal, and we support the local business communities in countries around the globe."</p>
<p>Dries Buytaert, the Drupal founder and project lead, President of Drupal Association, and CTO of Acquia, says, "The results of the survey verify my understanding of the situation of companies in the Drupal business community. I am very proud of the new opportunities and prospects these companies are creating for Drupal - and also feel satisfied that Drupal is seen as so good fit for their needs. And it gets even better with the soon to be released Drupal 8.2."</p>

    <p><em><a href="http://buytaert.net/the-transformation-of-drupal-8-for-continuous-innovation" rel="nofollow">Republished from buytaert.net</a>.</em></p>

<p>In the past, after every major release of Drupal, most innovation would shift to two areas: (1) contributed modules for the current release, and (2) core development work on the next major release of Drupal. This innovation model was the direct result of several long-standing policies, including <a href="http://buytaert.net/backward-compatibility" rel="nofollow">our culture of breaking backward compatibility</a> between major releases.</p>
<p>In many ways, this approach served us really well. It put strong emphasis on big architectural changes, for a cleaner, more modern, and more flexible codebase. The downsides were lengthy release cycles, a costly upgrade path, and low incentive for core contributors (as it could take years for their contribution to be available in production). Drupal 8's development was a great example of this; the <a href="http://buytaert.net/why-the-big-architectural-changes-in-drupal-8" rel="nofollow">architectural changes in Drupal 8</a> really propelled Drupal's codebase to be more modern and flexible, but also came at the cost of four and a half years of development and a complex upgrade path.</p>
<p>As Drupal grows — in lines of code, number of contributed modules, and market adoption — it becomes harder and harder to rely purely on backward compatibility breaks for innovation. As a result, we decided to evolve our philosophy starting after the release of Drupal 8.</p>
<p>The only way to stay competitive is to have the best product and to help people adopt it more seamlessly. This means that we have to continue to be able to reinvent ourselves, but that we need to make the resulting changes less scary and easier to absorb. We decided that we wanted more frequent releases of Drupal, with new features, API additions, and an easy upgrade path.</p>
<p>To achieve these goals, we adopted three new practices:</p>
<ol><li><a href="http://semver.org/" rel="nofollow">Semantic versioning</a>: a <em>major.minor.patch</em> versioning scheme that allows us to add significant, backwards-compatible improvements in minor releases like Drupal 8.1.0 and 8.2.0.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.drupal.org/core/release-cycle-overview" rel="nofollow">Scheduled releases</a>: new minor releases are timed twice a year for predictability. To ensure quality, each of these minor releases gets its own beta releases and release candidates with strict guidelines on allowed changes.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.drupal.org/core/experimental" rel="nofollow">Experimental modules in core</a>: optional alpha-stability modules shipped with the core package, which allow us to distribute new functionality, gather feedback, and iterate faster on the modules' planned path to stability.</li>
</ol><p>Now that Drupal 8 has been released for about 10 months and Drupal 8.2 is scheduled to be released next week, we can look back at how this new process worked. Drupal 8.1 introduced two new experimental modules (the <a href="http://buytaert.net/bigpipe-no-longer-just-for-the-top-50-websites" rel="nofollow">BigPipe module</a> and a user interface for data migration), various API additions, and usability improvements like spell checking in CKEditor. Drupal 8.2 further stabilizes the migration system and introduces numerous experimental alpha features, including <a href="http://buytaert.net/drupal-8-2-now-with-more-outside-in" rel="nofollow">significant usability improvements</a> (i.e. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osbegr_d_GY" rel="nofollow">block placement</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqmAvOA8MS0" rel="nofollow">block configuration</a>), date range support, and advanced content moderation — among a long list of other stable and experimental improvements.</p>
<p>It's clear that these regular feature updates help us innovate faster — we can now add new capabilities to Drupal that previously would have required a new major version. With experimental modules, we can get features in users' hands early, get feedback quickly, and validate that we are implementing the right things. And with the scheduled release cycle, we can deliver these improvements more frequently and more predictably. In aggregate, this enables us to innovate continuously; we can bring more value to our users in less time in a sustainable manner, and we can engage more developers to contribute to core.</p>
<p>It is exciting to see how Drupal 8 transformed our capabilities to continually innovate with core, and I'm looking forward to seeing what we accomplish next! It also raises questions about what this means for Drupal 9 — I'll cover that in a future blog post.</p>  </div>

  <div class="feed-item-body">
    <p>As you can see we've put a fresh coat of paint on Drupal.org - but the changes run below the surface. This latest iteration of the front page brings the key concepts of our <a href="../../../drupalorg/blog/a-new-design-system/index.html" rel="nofollow">design system</a> to the forefront: Clean, Modern, Technical.</p>
<p class="center"><a href="../../../files/Drupalorg-new-design-preview/index.html" rel="nofollow"></a></p>
<p>This change also brings new editorial tools for Drupal.org content editors. The new home page provides us more flexibility with content and presentation, and so you'll see more frequent updates, more information about DrupalCon, and more editorial flexibility on the home page than you've seen in the past. These tools are also helping us to build cleaner, modern landing pages - like you've just seen with our <a href="../../../association/membership/index.html" rel="nofollow">Fall Membership Campaign</a>.</p>
<p>We've previewed this work with several key members of the community and the board, and we want to say thank you to everyone who's given us their feedback on this first step for our new home page. We also want to give an extra special thank you to <a href="../../../u/dyannenova/index.html" rel="nofollow">dyannenova</a> for her contributions to this effort.</p>
<p>This is just the beginning - very soon we'll have a new visual look for the case studies that are featured on the home page, and then shortly after that we'll begin promoting solutions to Drupal evaluators in specific industries, like Higher Education, Media &amp; Publishing, and Government.</p>
<p>If Drupal.org is the home of the community, then the front page is our front door. We want to welcome new users and evaluators of Drupal, highlight the project's strengths, and promote news and happenings from throughout the ecosystem.</p>
<p>We hope you like the changes, and we think you'll like the upcoming iterations even more. We'd love to hear your feedback!</p>  </div>
